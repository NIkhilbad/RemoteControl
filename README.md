# RemoteControl
An app to control a robocar's movements using bluetooth. 
The app will send instructions according to the controls pressed by the user and they will be received by the bluetooth module connected to the robocar, which will process the signals further and issue corresponding controls to the wheels of the car. 
With a clean and minimal UI, the app is very simple to use and also looks beautiful.
